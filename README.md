# Noxys Fading

A Factorio modification that allows you to change the stack size of most items.

By default it multiplies all the stack size by 20 but you can change it in the mod settings to anything between 0.001 and 1000.

If you change it to a decimal below 1 you will decrease the stack sizes by that multiplier. The smallest stack size will always be 1 item.
